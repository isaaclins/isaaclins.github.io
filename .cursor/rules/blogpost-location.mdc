# Blog Post Location Rule

When a new blog post is requested, the location depends on the type of post.

- For a standard blog post, requested with a prompt like "make a new blogpost about X", the new file should be created in the `content/blog/` directory. The template for these posts is [`_TEMPLATE.md`](mdc:content/blog/_TEMPLATE.md).

- For a "How?" series blog post, requested with a prompt like "make a new 'how?' blogpost", the new file should be created in the `content/how/` directory. These posts explain technical concepts.

The main page for "How?" posts is [`_index.md`](mdc:content/how/_index.md).
The main page for standard blog posts is [`_index.md`](mdc:content/blog/_index.md).
