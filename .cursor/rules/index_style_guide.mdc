# Main Page & Site-Wide Writing Style

This document outlines the significance of the main page, [`content/_index.md`](mdc:content/_index.md), and establishes its writing style as the standard across this Hugo project.

## The Main Page: `content/_index.md`

The file [`content/_index.md`](mdc:content/_index.md) serves as the primary landing page for the website. It introduces Isaac Lins, his work, and provides key contact information and useful links.

## Core Writing Style

The style of [`content/_index.md`](mdc:content/_index.md) should be adopted for all content to maintain consistency and a strong personal brand. Key characteristics include:

## 1. Voice & Tone

- Use **first-person perspective** ("I", "my", "me").
- Maintain a **casual, friendly, and conversational tone**.
- Write as if you're talking to a technically inclined friend.
- Embrace humor, sarcasm, and playfulness.
- Use **internet lingo, memes, and casual phrasing**, but dont try too hard.

## 2. Structure & Formatting

- Use **clear section headers** (`##`, `###`) to break up content.
- Include:
  - **Tables** for quick comparisons.
  - **Bullet points** and **lists** for clarity.
  - **Code blocks** (```) for technical examples.
  - **Screenshots/GIFs** for visual support.
- Embed **links** directly in context.
- Use **bold**, _italics_, and `inline code` for emphasis and technical clarity.

## 3. Content Style

- **Be honest and opinionated**. Say what you think, even if it's blunt.
- Call out bad UX, paywalls, or bloat unapologetically.
- Use metaphors and analogies to explain concepts.
  - _"It felt like being charged for the steering wheel after buying the car."_
- Highlight personal workflows and real-world examples.
- Make room for tangents and personality.

## 4. Language & Grammar

- Prefer **contractions** ("it's", "don't", "you're").
- Be okay with **lowercase informality** in places (`ive`, `its`) when it fits the voice.
- Use **sentence fragments** and **short paragraphs** for rhythm.
- Swearing is okay, sparingly and for effect.
  - _"What the fuck do you think I'm made of?"_

## 5. Visuals & Media

- Include **custom images, diagrams, and GIFs** to break up text.
- Use humor in image captions and filenames.
  - _moistcritikal-screaming-ai-slowmotion.gif_
- Embed links with fun text:
  - `[**oooh click me! im a random link!**](mdc:#)`

## 6. Ending

- Wrap up with a personal reflection or final thought.
- Encourage readers to explore or try the tool themselves.
- Add a humorous or punchy final note:
  - _"Also, it's fucking free."_

## 7. Meta & Attribution

- Include a "Links" or "Credits" table if you reference tools.
- Make it clear youâ€™re not affiliated (if relevant).
  - _"I'm not affiliated with Raycast. I'm just a happy customer."_
