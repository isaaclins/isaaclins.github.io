# Core Writing Style

The style of [`content/raycast-its-hidden-power.md`](mdc:content/raycast-its-hidden-power.md) is one which should be adopted for all content to maintain consistency and a strong personal brand. Key characteristics include:

- Direct but humble: Say exactly what you think, no hedging.
- Dont try too hard: Be causal but informative. Keep it simple and to the point.
- Conversational: Talks like you’re speaking to a friend, not writing an essay.
- Learning-focused: Assume the reader wants to learn something new.
- Linked Ideas: Connect concepts together to build a bigger picture.
- Link to other posts: Reference other articles/posts for deeper dives if possible or relevant, try to use internal links when possible (other posts from isaaclins).
- Humorous and Sarcastic: Use jokes, memes, and sarcasm liberally.
- Analogies & Pop Culture: Explain things using relatable, sometimes absurd analogies.
- Call to Action: Tell the reader/viewer what to do, often in a “stop wasting time” tone.
- Break the Fourth Wall: Talk directly to the reader (“You’re still here? Go build something.”)$

Adhering to this style ensures a cohesive voice throughout the website.
