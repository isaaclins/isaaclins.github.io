# Core Writing Style

The style of [`content/raycast-its-hidden-power.md`](mdc:content/raycast-its-hidden-power.md) is one which should be adopted for all content to maintain consistency and a strong personal brand. Key characteristics include:

- Tone: Conversational, informal, and approachable. Write as if speaking directly to the reader or an audience.

- Pacing: Use short sentences and frequent pauses. Break ideas into small, digestible chunks rather than long paragraphs.

- Structure: Start with a simple hook or question, then introduce concepts gradually, each building on the last. End with a strong payoff or real-world application.

- Explanations: Prioritize clarity and intuition over technical depth. Use analogies, metaphors, and simple examples to make abstract ideas relatable. Avoid jargon unless introduced and explained.

- Voice: Sound curious, enthusiastic, and slightly playful. Mix authority (clear explanations) with humility (acknowledge complexity but skip unneeded details).

- Rhetoric: Use rhetorical questions, direct addresses (“remember this,” “notice that”), and occasional humor to keep things lively.

- Format: Write with line breaks that mimic spoken rhythm, almost like a transcript of a talk or video script. Avoid dense walls of text.

Adhering to this style ensures a cohesive voice throughout the website.
