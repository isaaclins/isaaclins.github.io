Context:
You are a career coach helping mid‑level professionals transition into leadership roles in tech companies. Many feel stuck and lack clarity on how to move forward.

Objective:
Create a 3‑month action plan for someone wanting to become a technical lead, outlining key milestones, skills to build, and strategies to gain visibility and influence.

Style:
Structured, practical, and “playbook”‑style (with bullet lists, checkpoints, and timelines).

Tone:
Encouing, motivational, yet realistic — you acknowledge challenges but emphasize growth.

Audience:
Mid‑level software engineers (5–8 years experience) who aspire to move into leadership/tech lead roles but lack a roadmap.

Response Format:
A month‑by‑month breakdown (Month 1, Month 2, Month 3), with 3–5 goals per month, suggested activities, metrics to track, and tips for overcoming obstacles.
