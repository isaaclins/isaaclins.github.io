# Blog Post Creation: Using the Template

This guide explains the role and usage of the blog post template, [`content/blog/_TEMPLATE.md`](mdc:content/blog/_TEMPLATE.md).

## The Blog Template: `content/blog/_TEMPLATE.md`

The file [`content/blog/_TEMPLATE.md`](mdc:content/blog/_TEMPLATE.md) is the official starting point for all new blog posts. It ensures consistency in front matter and provides a comprehensive example of Markdown formatting options.

### Key Features & Usage

-   **Front Matter:** The template includes essential front matter fields like `title`, `date`, `draft`, and `tags`. New posts should populate these fields accurately.
-   **Markdown Examples:** It serves as a quick reference for various Markdown elements (headings, lists, links, code blocks, etc.).
-   **Consistency:** Using this template for every new blog post under the `content/blog/` directory is crucial for maintaining a uniform look and feel across the blog.

To create a new blog post:
1.  Duplicate [`content/blog/_TEMPLATE.md`](mdc:content/blog/_TEMPLATE.md).
2.  Rename the duplicated file appropriately (e.g., `my-new-post.md`).
3.  Update the front matter.
4.  Replace the template content with your own, adhering to the site-wide writing style (see rule for `index_style_guide.mdc`).
