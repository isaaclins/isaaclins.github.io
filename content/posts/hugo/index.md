I've made this Website using **Hugo** and **Blowfish** (more on that later).

## What is Hugo?

Hugo is a open-source static site generator. Its well known for its speed, building websites at less than **1ms** per page! Its actually incredible if you ask me! As far as I'm aware, there isn't really a need for plugins, as there are **themes** for all types of sites you need. The best part? little to **no code**. Its all written in **Markdown**!

## What is Blowfish?

Now, let's talk about **Blowfish**. Blowfish is a theme for Hugo. It's designed to be clean, readable, and easy to modify. It's perfect for personal blogs or small websites. The Blowfish theme supports all the features you'd expect from a modern static website: responsive design, SEO-friendly markup, and fast load times.

One of the best things about using a theme like Blowfish is that it allows you to focus on your content, rather than the technical details of website design. You can easily customize the look and feel of your site by modifying the theme's config files, which also have no code!

## How to set up Hugo with Blowfish

I personally will not make a tutorial, but here is a tutorial I found that helped me out a lot!
