If you're a Mac user (or even a Windows or Linux user) looking to get more shit done, you're in the right place. I'm constantly tweaking my setup for peak efficiency, and in the last few days, I've decided on a set of apps that I genuinely couldn't live without. These are the tools that run daily, keeping my workflow smooth and upgrading to a poweruser.

Let's dive into the arsenal.

{{< toc >}}

I made a list of all the apps I use on my Mac. I'm going to go through each one and explain what I use them for.


## The Apps

### **Hammerspoon**

![Hammerspoon icon](/images/svg/hammerspoon.svg)

- **What it is:**:

An incredibly powerful automation tool for macOS. ([hammerspoon.org](https://www.hammerspoon.org/))

- **What it does:**
It lets you write Lua scripts to control almost anything on your Mac – window management, application shortcuts, system 
events, you name it. Think of it as giving your Mac a custom-built OS layer, tailored to your exact needs.


- **Why I use it:** For the insane level of customization. I've got custom hotkeys for snapping windows, specific app 
behaviors, and little scripts that automate repetitive crap. It's a bit of a tinkerer's dream, but once set up, it's gold.

### **Raycast**

![Raycast icon](/images/svg/raycast.svg)

- **What it is:** 
A supercharged command palette and launcher. ([raycast.com](https://www.raycast.com/))


- **What it does:** Replaces Spotlight on steroids. Launches apps, calculates things, searches files, runs scripts, 
controls system settings, manages clipboard history, snippets, and a ton more through its extension ecosystem.


- **Why I use it:** It's faster than fumbling through menus or multiple apps. Everything I need is a few keystrokes away. 
The extensibility means I can integrate pretty much any workflow into it.

> ### **Latest**

![Latest icon](/images/svg/latest.svg)

> **What it is:** 
> free, open-source app update checker. ([max.codes/latest](https://max.codes/latest/))


>- **What it does:** 
> > Scans your installed applications (especially non-App Store ones) and tells you if there are new 
> >versions available.

>**Why I use it:** Keeps my software fresh without me having to manually check every damn website or wait for a built-in 
> > updater to decide it's time. Security and new features, baby.

### **battery** (the app, not the icon)

![battery icon](/images/svg/battery.svg)

- **What it is:** A menu bar utility for more detailed battery information. ([sindresorhus.com/battery-indicator](https://sindresorhus.com/battery-indicator))
- **What it does:** Gives a clearer, often more precise, look at battery health, charge cycles, time remaining, and sometimes temperature, depending on the specific app (there are a few good ones out there that fit this description).
- **Why I use it:** The default macOS battery icon is a bit too minimalist for my taste. I like knowing exactly what's up with my battery, especially when I'm on the go.

### **TinkerTool**

![TinkerTool icon](/images/svg/tinkertool.svg)

- **What it is:** A gateway to hidden macOS settings. ([bresink.com/osx/TinkerTool.html](http://www.bresink.com/osx/TinkerTool.html))
- **What it does:** Unlocks a bunch of preferences and features that Apple doesn't expose in the standard System Settings. You can tweak things like Finder behavior, Dock appearance, and even some application-specific settings.
- **Why I use it:** Because sometimes Apple thinks it knows best, and sometimes I disagree. TinkerTool lets me fine-tune the OS to my liking, often enabling settings that improve my workflow or just make the OS less annoying.

### **MiddleClick**

![MiddleClick icon](/images/svg/middleclick.svg)

- **What it is:** A simple utility to enable middle-click functionality. ([middleclick.app](https://middleclick.app/))
- **What it does:** Typically allows a three-finger tap on a trackpad (or a custom gesture on a Magic Mouse) to act as a middle mouse button click.
- **Why I use it:** Browsing efficiency. Opening links in new tabs, closing tabs – it's a small thing, but once you're used to middle-click, living without it is like trying to type with one hand tied behind your back.

### **AltTab**

![AltTab icon](/images/svg/alttab.svg)

- **What it is:** Brings Windows-style alt-tabbing to macOS. ([alt-tab-macos.netlify.app](https://alt-tab-macos.netlify.app/))
- **What it does:** Instead of cycling through app icons, it shows actual window previews, making it much easier to switch to the specific window you want, especially when you have multiple windows of the same app open.
- **Why I use it:** It's just a more efficient way to switch windows for me. I came from Windows a long time ago, and this is one habit I'm happy to keep. Seeing the actual window content before switching is a no-brainer.

### **Nimble Commander**

![Nimble Commander icon](/images/svg/nimblecommander.svg)

- **What it is:** A dual-pane file manager. ([magnumbytes.com](https://magnumbytes.com/))
- **What it does:** Provides a Norton Commander-style interface for file operations. Two panels, side-by-side, making moving, copying, comparing, and managing files much quicker than with Finder for complex tasks.
- **Why I use it:** For heavy-duty file management, Finder just doesn't cut it. Nimble Commander is fast, keyboard-friendly, and powerful. If you're shuffling lots of files around, this is a godsend.

### **Amphetamine**

![Amphetamine icon](/images/svg/amphetamine.svg)

- **What it is:** A keep-awake utility. ([Mac App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/amphetamine/id937984704?mt=12))
- **What it does:** Prevents your Mac from going to sleep, dimming the screen, or starting the screensaver. You can set it to run indefinitely or for a specific duration.
- **Why I use it:** Presentations, long-running scripts, big downloads, or any time I need my Mac to just _stay on_ without me having to jiggle the mouse like an idiot.

### **Horo**

![Horo icon](/images/svg/horo.svg)

- **What it is:** A simple menu bar timer app. ([matthewpalmer.net/horo-free-timer-mac/](https://matthewpalmer.net/horo-free-timer-mac/))
- **What it does:** Lets you quickly set timers and countdowns directly from your menu bar.
- **Why I use it:** Pomodoro technique, reminders to take a break, or just timing a specific task. It's quick, unobtrusive, and always there.

### **MediaMate**

![MediaMate icon](/images/svg/mediamate.svg)

- **What it is:** An enhanced media and system HUD (Heads-Up Display). ([wouter01.github.io/MediaMate/](https://wouter01.github.io/MediaMate/))
- **What it does:** Customizes the on-screen displays for volume, brightness, and media playback. Think better looking, more informative pop-ups when you hit your media keys.
- **Why I use it:** The stock macOS HUDs are... functional. MediaMate makes them look better and often provides more useful info (like album art in the Now Playing HUD). **This is the ONLY app in this entire list that I've actually paid for. Eight bucks. That's it.** And for the polish it adds, totally worth it.

### **Ice**

![Ice icon](/images/svg/ice.svg)

- **What it is:** A menu bar icon manager. ([icemenubar.app](https://icemenubar.app/))
- **What it does:** Lets you hide or temporarily tuck away icons in your menu bar. Essential if you have a lot of menu bar apps (like I clearly do).
- **Why I use it:** Keeps my menu bar clean and distraction-free. I can hide icons I don't need to see all the time but still want accessible. Essential for maintaining sanity on a smaller screen or just for a minimalist aesthetic.

### **Ghostty**

![Ghostty icon](/images/svg/ghostty.svg)

- **What it is:** A GPU-accelerated terminal emulator. ([ghostty.org](https://ghostty.org/))
- **What it does:** Provides a fast, modern terminal experience. These usually focus on performance, customizability, and sometimes unique features compared to the built-in Terminal.app.
- **Why I use it:** As a developer, I live in the terminal. Ghostty (or any good alternative like iTerm2, Kitty, WezTerm, etc.) offers better performance, more features (like multiplexing, better font rendering, true color) than the default. A good terminal is non-negotiable.
  > I've delved deeper into Ghostty over at [my post on the Ghostty & Fish Combo](/blog/ghostty-fish-perfect-combo/).

### **AppCleaner**

![AppCleaner icon](/images/svg/appcleaner.svg)

- **What it is:** An uninstaller utility. ([freemacsoft.net/appcleaner/](https://freemacsoft.net/appcleaner/))
- **What it does:** When you delete an app by just dragging it to the Trash, it often leaves behind preference files, caches, and other associated gunk. AppCleaner finds and removes all these related files.
- **Why I use it:** To keep my Mac clean and reclaim disk space. It ensures that when I uninstall an app, it's _really_ gone.

## That's a Wrap (For Now)

So there you have it – the current lineup of tools that keep my Mac running like a well-oiled machine. The best part? Almost all of this power comes free of charge, with just one exception that set me back a whole eight dollars.

What are your go-to Mac utilities? Let me know!
