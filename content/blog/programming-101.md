I've got alot of friends that say stuff like:

> How do I learn to code?

Here, I will try to explain the basics of programming in a way that is easy to understand.

## Basic Concepts

| Concept              | Description                                                | Examples                                                          |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Hardware             | The physical components of a computer. Stuff you CAN touch | Keyboard, mouse, monitor, CPU, RAM, etc.                          |
| Software             | The programs and data that run on a computer.              | Word, Excel, Chrome, VSCode, etc.                                 |
| Data                 | Information that is stored.                                | Text, images, videos, etc.                                        |
| Programming Language | A language that tells a computer what to do.               | Python, Java, JavaScript, etc.                                    |
| Computer Program     | A set of instructions that tell a computer what to do.     | A program that opens a browser, a program that plays a game, etc. |
| Variables            | A way to store information in a computer program.          | `name = "John"`                                                   |

So to recap:

- The `Hardware` is the physical components of a computer. Stuff you CAN touch.
- The `Software` is the programs and data that run on a computer. Stuff you CANNOT touch.
- We tell the computer what to do using a `programming language`.
- The Computer Program is a set of instructions that tell a computer what to do.
- The Variables are a way to store information in a computer program.

## Example

Lets say you want to build the simplest possible program.
We will use `Python`, a programming language that is easy to learn.

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

This code (the `print("Hello, World!")`) will print "Hello, World!" to the console.
lets see it in action:

Okay, but when I want to run it again, I have to write the code again?

No, bigot.

We **write it into a file**. just like you write your passwords into a `.txt` file, we just write our code into a `.py` file.
Thats called `file extension`.

Lets see it in action:
I've written the following code:

```python
# We can also add comments!
# If a line starts with "#", it won't be executed
# <-- just like this
print("Hello World!")
```

I've saved it as `example-hello-world.py`

Okay, but how do I run it?

We use a `terminal` to run the code.

A terminal is a program that allows you to interact with the computer.
