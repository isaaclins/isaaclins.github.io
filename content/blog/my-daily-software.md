## Introduction

If you're a Mac user (or even a Windows or Linux user) looking to get more shit done, you're in the right place. I'm constantly tweaking my setup for peak efficiency, and in the last few days, I've decided on a set of apps that I genuinely couldn't live without. These are the tools that run daily, keeping my workflow smooth and upgrading to a poweruser.

Let's dive into the arsenal.

I made a list of all the apps I use on my Mac. I'm going to go through each one and explain what I use them for.

## My uses

I'm a software developer, so I use a lot of tools to help me get my work done. I'm also a bit of a tinkerer, so I like to try out new apps and see if they can help me be more productive.

## Cursor

Cursor is a modern, AI-powered code editor. It's a great tool for writing code, and it's also a great tool for writing blog posts.

In short, It's a fork of VSCode, but with AI-powered features.

Here is an example of how it looks like:

I'm not going to go into detail about how it works, but I'll just say that it's a great tool for writing code.
