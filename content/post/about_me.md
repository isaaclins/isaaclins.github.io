## I'm an Application Developer

From an early age, I devseloped a keen interest in the field of **cybersecurity**, and now I am pursuing my passion by diving deep into various programming languages and technologies.

As part of my apprenticeship, I am gaining hands-on experience in a range of essential languages such as [**HTML**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML), [**CSS**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS), [**Java**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)), [**Python**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)), [**SQL**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL), [**Batch**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batch_file), and [**JavaScript**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Javascript), with a focus on their application in the realm of cybersecurity.

Scripting has become a thrilling aspect of my learning journey. I derive great satisfaction from crafting efficient and robust scripts that automate tasks, enhance system security, or even sometimes break them.

Although I am at the very beginning of my career, my ultimate ambition is to become a member of an esteemed **Red Team**, known for their expertise in ethical hacking and vulnerability assessments.

With my unwavering determination, I am actively working towards this goal, honing my skills, and staying up to date with the latest advancements in cybersecurity.

I am grateful for the opportunity to work at Swisscom, where I can combine my passion for programming with my fascination for cybersecurity. Each day brings new challenges and learning experiences, which I embrace wholeheartedly as stepping stones on my journey to become a proficient and respected member of the Red Team.

I'm also really into philosophy and understanding how people think. It's not just a small interest, but something I'm really curious about and always want to learn more about.

I agree a lot with the ideas of *Albert Camus*, a famous French philosopher. He wrote books like [**'The Myth of Sisyphus'**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Myth_of_Sisyphus) that talk about how life doesn't have a clear meaning, and how we're all going to die someday. These ideas have really influenced how I see the world.

Camus thought that life doesn't have a built-in purpose, and it's up to each person to decide what's important to them. I find this idea really interesting. Even though life can seem pointless, we should still try to find happiness and meaning. This way of thinking has helped me understand why we're here and what we're supposed to do.

In short, philosophy isn't just something I do for fun. It's a big part of how I see the world and interact with others. Like *Albert Camus*, I'm always trying to understand what it means to be human and the big questions of life. It's not always easy, but I'm really interested and want to understand as much as I can.

If you have some free time, I really recommend looking at [**this video**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35s4-3T5dJY) by *Sysiphus 55*.
This is one of those gold veins that you sometimes come across on youtube ;)
