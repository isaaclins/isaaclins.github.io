# Isaac Lins

**Application Developer & Cybersecurity Enthusiast**

Hi, I'm Isaac. I build applications and break things on purpose to learn how they work. I'm currently working at Swisscom and I'm passionate about cybersecurity. My dream is simple: join a top Red-Team and make technology safer.

## What I Do

- **Develop:** I craft clean, efficient applications using Java, Python, JavaScript, and more.
- **Secure:** I dive into cybersecurity, always exploring vulnerabilities and learning to defend against them.
- **Innovate:** I enjoy experimenting and pushing the limits of what technology can do.

I write about my experiences and thoughts on technology, software, and more.
Here are some of my latest posts:
